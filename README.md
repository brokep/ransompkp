# RansomPKP

Basic PoC of hostile HPKP Suicide, as discussed in Bryant Zadegan and Ryan Lester's
Black Hat / DEF CON talk "Abusing Bleeding Edge Web Standards for AppSec Glory".

Despite the tongue-in-cheek name, this is _not_ ransomware. It's merely a
demonstration of a concept that could _hypothetically_ be implemented within some
future ransomware package, uncovered in the course of our security research.

This also is _not_ an exploit that facilitates attaining root access to a box.
Doing so would be a _prerequisite_ to using a hypothetical RansomPKP-based
ransomware package, and as such would be entirely left as an exercise to the
attacker.
